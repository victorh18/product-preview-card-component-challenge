## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most interesting thing I feel I learnt with this project is how different height works compared to width, even with Flexbox. This means that in your media queries, when adjusting your layout, you may have to write some more code than expected to get the desired results.

I also got the opportunity to practice importing local fonts to the page.

Also, I'm very proud of my button ðŸ¤˜

### Continued development

My next goal for this project is using more advanced CSS features, like variables, and extend nesting where appropiate.
